#### [Component-Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

- A "component" is a an independent, reusable code block, which helps to divide user interfaces into smaller pieces.
- The characteristics of a component include being reuseable, replaceable, not context specific, extensible, encapsulated, and independent.
- Advantages of using component-based architecture include easier deployment, reduced cost, easier development, reusability, modification of technical complexity, reliability, system maintenance and evolution, and independency.

#### [What is Props and How to Use it in React](https://itnext.io/what-is-props-and-how-to-use-it-in-react-da307f500da0#:~:text=%E2%80%9CProps%E2%80%9D%20is%20a%20special%20keyword,way%20from%20parent%20to%20child)
