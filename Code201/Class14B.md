Key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams are group norms, empathy, a the feeling of a safe space.

In the past I have been in teams that tried to replicate something similar to what google had accomplished, a team that was open and communicated with one another freely and without risk. Specifically the team I am in now at work I would not consider psychologically safe, despite trying to be. I believe the failure is due to their lack of emotional intelligence. I have witnessed them take part in ugly gossip that made me feel wholly uncomfortable, and after declining to take part, feeling like I'd somehow othered myself. Things changed afterward as I put up more boundaries between myself and work, hearing they'd turned their gossip on to me with myself refusing to feel judgment for staying true to my character. We still work, and reach deadlines, and get things done, but their attempts to connect with me since feel ingenuine, as I've seen the ugly and little to no change in their emotional intelligence. Furthermore I think a team that becomes a psychologically safe place is one that must take into account the intersectional identities that some individuals may have, because to those people communicating without risk is almost non existant. BIPOC are often described as aggressive, rude or mean in settings without other BIPOC, and it wont change without non POC having a better understanding of the stigma that exist around the way people in those groups communicate. (I bring this up because I believe this should also be a factor of pysch safety, as assuming it exists due to a company's DEI statement or mission doesnt ensure it's actually being practiced.) 

Teams that operate with a high degree of psych safety work better together, offering efficiency, comradery and a higher job satisfaction rate.
