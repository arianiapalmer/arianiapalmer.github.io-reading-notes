### *Reading 5: HTML Images; CSS Color, text*

#### HTML Media

A real world use for the alt attribute in a website is when a webpage isn't rendering due to a poor connection so the image isnt able to load, the user still has an idea of what is is that's supposed to be there.
To help improve the accessibility of images in an HTML document you can add titles, captions, and to your images.
The figure element would be useful in an HTML Document when you have alot of pictures in a document and each has it own caption, figure tags make it more accessible and stylable on a larger scale.
The difference between a gif and svg is  gif is use specifically for interchanging graphics while svg is used to draw graphics and where size may become a changing factor.
I would prefer to use png to display a screenshot on my web page because it would better display text.

#### Learn CSS 

The difference between foreground and background colors is that foreground sets the color of the entire element, like the text, while background color only changes the background color, behind the text.
I would give the entire page a theme of three colors, with a base one and three accent colors, probable using the paletton since its what i liked the best.
When choosing fonts for an HTML document, you should consider its browser availability.

 - Font size can change the size of the font on a page, keeping in mind that it inherits a parent value from the html document.
 - font weight sets how bold the text is
 - font style is used to turn italic text on or off

Two ways you can add spacing around the characters in an h1 document is by using letter-spacing and font-stretch.
