# Ari's Class Notes

**Hello there!** My name is Ari, welcome to my GitHub.

## A little bit about me

I'm 22, I live in Columbus, OH and I went to school in Pittsburgh for a BA in Global Cultural Studies.
I enjoy being outside, roller skating, yoga, reading, playing video games, and relaxing.
I have 2 cats and a recently adopted fern.

I enjoy learning about different cultures, languages, and mythology.

I'm taking classes at code fellows because I've always been a technically oriented person. When I first began my journey of learning,I was originally on a STEM, but wanted to switch things up a bit - hence my pursing a degree in cultural studies. It was the perfect thing that I needed to help round out my learning, and now I am back on a stem path to aquire the necessary technical skills for a career.
