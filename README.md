# Ari's Class Notes
**Hello there!** My name is Ari, welcome to my GitHub. 
## A little bit about me:
I'm 21, I live in Columbus, OH and I went to school in Pittsburgh for a BA in Global Cultural Studies. 
I enjoy being outside, yoga, reading, playing video games, and relaxing. 
I have 2 cats and 5 kittens (if you live in the metro Columbus area and want a cat hmu!)

I enjoy learning about different cultures, languages, and mythology. I swear I should have gone to school for anthropology, but what's done is done lol! 
I'm taking classes at code fellows because I've always been a technically oriented person. I was originally on a STEM path in life, but wanted to switch things up a bit. It was the perfect thing that I needed to help round out my learning, and now I am back on a stem path to aquire technical skills for a career.
