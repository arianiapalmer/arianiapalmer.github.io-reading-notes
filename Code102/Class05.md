### *Reading 5: Design Web Pages with CSS*

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language developers use to make a website look presentable.  CSS documents are made by saving your text file as filename.css. In CSS you can change the color and size of headings and links, to create layouts, adding columns and other design features. You define the rules by specifying what should be applied to elements or groups on your web page.

> The properties is CSS have different allowable values. For example:
> - The property ‘color’ can have various color values (like red, rbg values, hexadecimal, etc.)

CSS documents are made by saving your text file as filename.css. All web standards technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are defined in giant documents called specifications (or "specs"), which are published by standards organizations and define precisely how those technologies are supposed to behave. CSS is developed within the W3C and their site contains a directory for available syntax that can be used in your styling [found here]:(https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) 

There are 3 ways of adding CSS  to your site:
- Internal CSS: Edit your website’s styling through the <style> element in, in the <head> section of your HTML document
- External CSS: Edit your website’s styling through just one file. Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.
- Inline CSS: Edit a single element in your website using the style element within the necessary section
