### *Reading 8: Operators and Loops*

JavaScript has a wide range of operators, some that weâ€™re already used like: assignment operators, string operators, comma operator, and relational operator. For this reading the focus will be on comparison operators and assignment operators as well as for statement and while statement loops.

Operators

> - Comparison: An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = f() is an assignment expression that assigns the value of f() to x.
> - Assignment:  A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.

Loops

> - For statement: A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
> - While statement: A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.
