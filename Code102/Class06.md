### *Reading 6: Dynamic Web Pages With JavaScript*

JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages. It allows you to have dynamic content to make a website interactive.
Where HTML is what is in a site, and CSS is what a site looks like, JavaScript is what a website is doing. JavaScript is a great tool so that website’s aren’t just boring word blobs. 

As a beginner, a fundamental thing to learn in JavaScript is about variables. Understanding how to declare variables is important because sometimes variables can look like values, and then things get confusing. Variables are containers for storing data. Always declare JavaScript variables with var, let, or const. You should always declare variables with const. and if you think the value of the variable can change, use let.

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. Proper formatting for these identifiers is important because they are case-sensitive. 

In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator. It allows you to assign a value to a variable. JavaScript variables hold numbers and text values, with text values being known as strings. Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes. If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.

Creating a variable in JavaScript is called declaring a variable, and the variable will be undefined until a value is assigned to it (using the = sign). It is good practice to declare your variables at the beginning of a script. You can declare multiple variables in one statement using commas to separate your variables.
