### *Reading 1: Basic markdown syntax and GitHub.*

There are plenty of ways to make your vision come to fruition when it comes to markdown. In today’s reading I found my preferred syntax and use of markdown. Here are my preferred ways to do different things on markdown, and what their counterpart is in HTML.

#### Headings
- #Heading  also < h1> tag
- Remember to put blank lines before and after a heading for best compatibility

#### Paragraphs
- Simply type the text in your paragraph, but don’t use any indents, and make sure to use a blank line before and after to separate lines of text
- Also < p > Simply type the text in your paragraph, but don’t use any indents, and make sure to use a blank line before and after to separate lines of text < /p>
  - To indent use ( &nbsp;)
  -To center text use <center> text < /center>

#### Line Breaks
* As someone who really enjoys line breaks and page breaks when writing, i found this bit quite helpful

- In markdown you can have a line break just by starting a new line.
- In HTML you can have a line break by adding < br> wherever you need the break within the < p> < /p> tag. The line break tagged does not need to be closed.

#### Bold Font
- In markdown there are a few ways to do this, but I prefer using stars. * *  before and after the bolded text * *
- In HTML you would use the < strong> tag before and after the bolded text < /strong>
- (you can * * even * * throw it in < strong> randomly in a sentence < /strong> for a little more emphasis

#### Italics
- In markdown I prefer the use of the single * star for italics *
- In HTML you would use the <em>tag for italics</em>

#### Bold and Italic 
 - In markdown: * * * three stars for the most fun emphasis * * *
 - In HTML < em> < strong> use the em and strong tag and be sure to close them when done!< /em> < /strong>

#### Blockquotes
- I enjoy block quotes quite a bit and they’re so easy! Just through in a  (>)  with a space after and blank lines before and after the line of text and you’re good to go.
- You can even nest it with two >> and throw in other elements for some personalization

#### Lists!
* I love lists as you can probably tell by now
- In markdown you can do the traditional 1. And it will start your first item on the ordered list. If you mess up a number, don’t worry - computers are smart and they know what you meant to say
- In HTML you would use the ordered list tag < ol> < / ol> immediately followed by and line and the list tag < li> < /li> for each item on the list. So if you had two items on a list you would have < ol>< li>one< /li> < li>two< /li>< /ol>
- For an unordered list in markdown you could simply use -, *, +, and even indent (but don’t mix and match - the one you started with is the one you end with)
- In HTML you would use the unordered list tag < ul>< li>along with the list tag< /li> < li>and don’t forget to break up the text with a line< /li>< /ul>
