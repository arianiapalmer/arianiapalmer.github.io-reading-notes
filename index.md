### *Assignment 1: Explain the growth mindset in your own words.*
The growth mindset is a framework for thinking that puts progress as the leading direction of thought. Having a growth mindset as the leading direction of your everyday thoughts can allow you to overcome challenges and situations more efficiently and allow you to grow as as person. A growth mindset allows your learning to be flexible and varied, while a fixed mindset can cause you to be stagnant and make very little progress. An example of a fixed mindset versus a growth mindset is believing that the qualities you came into this life with are the qualities you leave this life with - it limits your growth by telling yourself you can’t be anything more than what you originally were. 

Having a growth mindset will push you to see obstacles as opportunities for growth, to become more than what you previously were, and to know that it is possible. Having a growth mindset means learning to work around tough obstacles even if you’ve not encountered them before, it means learning how to give effort when you lose motivation, learning how to take criticism not as criticism but as feedback meant to help you grow. A growth mindset can help you to mature, to see the growth of your peers as a way for you to grow too, seeing them not as obstacles but as resources for your own growth because there simply is no “I” in “team”. Realizing that there is truth to “when one rises we all rise”.

 A growth mindset translates not just to work but to your outside life as well - it can help you to be a better you in your daily life by pushing you to be better in your relationships, because you’re learning to take off the limiting lenses of a fixed mindset. To see yourself and your skills as something that can grow, that is not limited by time, direction, who you were before or even who you want to be. It  can allow you to reach corners of yourself you never thought possible.
 
 
 > **Reminders to keep myself in a growth mindset**
 > - Look to my peers - Where are they at? If we are not in the same place, then it may be time for a check in. Hear what obstacles they've faced and share my experiences. This is an opportunity to grow together.
 > - Ask for Help! - It can be hard sometimes to ask for help when you really want to understand something on your own. But help can be the turning point to your understanding! So don't be shy, there are plenty of resources who are more than glad to offer their help, learn to take advantage.
 >  - Self reflect  - Am I turning in quality work that reflects where I want to be going? If not it may be time to beef some of the studying up. Or get a bit more creative. Insert my intrests into the work I am turnning in to make it feel like an extension of me, of my personality. 

A little self reflection made me realize I should show a bit more of myself, here's some emojis to give you an idea of the person that I am lol!
