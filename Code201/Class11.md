It is important to fallback content in the video element not all browsers support all media types and this lets a user know that there is content but it cant be viewed and why it cant be viewed

Whereas flex layout allows you to keep content in place with different screen sizes based on a flow direction, grid allows you to do the same based on specific sections determined by gridlines. Flex is best suited for smaller scale websites while grid is best suited for larger scale websites.
Grid container is a parent that defines the element as the container for the grid for which child properties are to follow; grid item is a direct descendant, or child, of grid; and grid line is the dividing lines that make up the structure of a grid.
