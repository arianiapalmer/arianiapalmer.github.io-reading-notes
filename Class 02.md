# Reading 2: The Coder’s Computer
## Choosing a Text Editor

Choosing a text editor is the first component of making a computer the best friend of a developer. There are plenty of text editors to choose from but finding the right one for you can take looking at the features it supplies. Features to look out for are code completion, shorthand, syntax highlighting, different themes to choose from, and the ability to choose from a decent selection of extensions.

There are text editing software that already comes with your computer, like “Text Edit” on mac, and “notepad” on windows. Linux has a variety of text editors as well, but usually these text editors don’t have many of those cool features that help make coding efficient. Using the original text editor on your computer is fine but you have to be sure the text is plain as you code, and to make sure that you create a main folder on your computer with all the files for the website you are coding. Part of this is also making sure that you are saving the files with the appropriate extension at the end of the file names. 

Some other options that you can download are Notepad++, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Aton Brackets, and Sublime Text.

- Notepad ++ has syntax highlighting, code completion, word completion, function completion, zoom, an online community, chat room, and a searchable wiki page
- BB Edit can be purchased and has lots of features
- Visual Studio Code is a free text editor for windows, mac, and linux computers. It has Emmet shorthand for HTML and CSS, syntax highlighting, themes, extensions and code completion
- Atom is free for windows, mac, and linux computers. It was made by the folks at Github and has syntax highlighting, themes, extensions and plenty other great features
Brackets is a text editor that is free for windows, mac, and linux computers. Created by adobe it supporots HTML, CSS, JavaScript and you can add more coding capabilities through extensions. It has features like live preview which updates your website once you make a change automatically
- Sublime text can be purchased for $70 or they offer a free version. It is known for being fast and responsive and extensible. It has syntax highlighting, code completion, themes and extensions

Text editors allow you to write code, but an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a suite of different software coming together. And IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package. 

### Terminal Cheat Sheet
Teminal Commands
1. First line should be the command prompt
  1. Then you enter in your command line arguments, followed by any options that serve to modify the behaviour of the command should you need it
  2. The following lines are the output from the running command. Some commands perform the task and don't display any information unless there is an error
2. The last line should be your command prompt again, as your terminal is ready for the next thing you want to throw at it
* Bash - Bourne again shell; part of the operating system which defines how the terminal will behave and look after running commands for you
Using the command Echo will state your current shell

* Pwd - Printing Working Directory; this command tell you what your current or present working directory is. This command can be really useful to remind yourself where you presently are in a terminal full of code
* Is - list - can be used without any arguments, which will just show you where you are. To use it with arguments/options: Is[options][location]

Absolute and Relative Paths - whenever we refer to a file or directory, that is a pth. A path is a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system

- Absolute paths specify a location in relation to the root directory. Begins with a forward slash/
- Relative paths specify a location relative to where we currently are in the system
