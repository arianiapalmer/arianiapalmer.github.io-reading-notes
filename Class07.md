### *Reading 7: Pragramming With JavaScript*

Like learning any language, learning JavaScript includes many new vocabulary. 

Control Flow
> - The order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
Conditionals 
> - Conditional structures like ifâ€¦else are can be used so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not
Loop
> - Iterates through all of the fields in the form, checking each one in turn to see if the statements are met
Function
> - A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
> - funtions are executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
> - function name (parameter1, ){code to be executed}
> - Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
> - Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.
