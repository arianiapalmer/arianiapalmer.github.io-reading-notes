### *Reading 4: Stucture Web Pages With HITML*

What is HTML? HTML stands for hypertext markup language. Coding in HTML is how you structure a website. The best way to go about structuring a web page is to first create an outline, called a wireframe. The wireframe should be created with the purpose of the webpage in mind, audience, and what is expected to be seen by the audience. After creating a wireframe skeleton it is then time to put some meat on those bones! Some things to keep in mind when wireframing:

> * Keep it clear - make it easy for the user to maneuver without getting too distracted with aesthetics. No one likes clutter!
> * Be predictable - most people are used to a predictable use of websites, including common buttons, positions, and navigational processes. Try to stick to that kind of predictability so that users can use your website with confidence
> * Keep it simple - Along with keeping it clear, keeping things simple means to lay your website out in an intuitive way that most can predict. That way a user won't get lost in links, information, and other kinds of fluff. Have your website serve its purpose, but donâ€™t drown it in unnecessary fluff.
